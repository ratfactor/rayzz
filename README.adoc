= Rayzz

A raytracer in https://ziglang.org/[Zig]. I've just started it!

It can currently render a simple scene in solid color (no lighting, shadows,
reflections, etc.).

This is what it can currently render:

I'm working from the book 
https://nostarch.com/computer-graphics-scratch[Computer Graphics from Scratch] by Gabriel Gambetta.
I'm learning a ton and enjoying myself very much.
